# AnnDocuGen

## Preparation

One-time only: `./download.sh` (downloads ANTLR and ANTLR Runtime)

## Usage

`./build.sh` (cleans everything and rebuilds everything)

## Experimenting

`./clean.sh` (cleans everything)

`./build-antlr.sh` (makes sense after `clean.sh`, only builds the Java parser)

## Future

Maven, of course.
