## Preparation

Make sure you have an environment variable called `JAVA_HOME` defined
and pointing to a root directory of a JDK installation
(typically `/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/` or similar).

## Usage

`./clean.sh` (cleans everything)

`./build.sh` (cleans everything and rebuilds everything)

## Future

Maven, of course.
